 * The audio input 1 is now an LFO or audio-rate frequency modulation input.  
   This input is not DC-coupled, so patching constant voltages will not work. 
   Anyways, it's possible to add LFOs or even audio rate modulation to it. 
   The input voltage follows the 1V/Octave convention, so an LFO that peaks 
   at +1V and -1V will make the frequencies of all the partials shift of one 
   octave higher and one lower.
 * The Gate input 1 is now a sync input to to reset the phase of all the 
   partials. The phase is configured from Audio input 4
 * Capped maximum value of the partials to avoid glitches: maximum value is 
   now 40 for Sine and the Poly\* waveforms, 80 for all other waveforms
 * Renamed acronym for normal comb and different comb
 * The fundamental is transposed one octave lower
 * Changed the startup preset to something more interesting (30 partials, comb)
 * 1 decimal value floating point print of fundamental input voltage

 * Stretch parameter is now represented in 1V/Octave format, so C0 is a
   multiplier of 0, C1 => 1, C2=> 2, C3 => 3 etc. This results in more harmonic results
   in sending pitch information to this parameter.

 * Changed naming of some parameters and settings
 * Human-readable abbreviations of the wave shapes instead of numbers
 * New "normal" comb filter amplitude scheme C1: various notches that can be shifted with the knob and CV input
 * New "different" comb filter amplitude scheme C2: similar to C1 but the frequency of the notches gets increases as the partial index get higher
 * Added a graphical visualization of the amplitude of the first 30 partials by using ASCII tricks
