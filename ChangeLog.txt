 * Stretch parameter is now represented in 1V/Octave format, so C0 is a
   multiplier of 0, C1 => 1, C2=> 2, C3 => 3 etc. This results in more harmonic results
   in modulating this parameter.

 * Changed naming of some parameters and settings
 * Human-readable abbreviations of the wave shapes instead of numbers
 * New "normal" comb filter amplitude scheme C1: various notches that can be shifted with the knob and CV input
 * New "different" comb filter amplitude scheme C2: similar to C1 but the frequency of the notches gets increases as the partial index get higher
 * Added a graphical visualization of the amplitude of the first 30 partials by using ASCII tricks
