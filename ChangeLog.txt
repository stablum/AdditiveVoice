 * The audio input 1 is now an LFO or audio-rate frequency modulation input.  
   This input is not DC-coupled, so patching constant voltages will not work. 
   Anyways, it's possible to add LFOs or even audio rate modulation to it. 
   The input voltage follows the 1V/Octave convention, so an LFO that peaks 
   at +1V and -1V will make the frequencies of all the partials shift of one 
   octave higher and one lower.
 * The Gate input 1 is now a sync input to to reset the phase of all the 
   partials. The phase is configured from Audio input 4 in this way:
   when the sampled input is 0, then all phases are zero; 
   with larger inputs the phase spread among the partials is getting larger. 
   This means that the first partial will always be reset with phase 0 and the 
   last partial is going to have the largest phase value: 
   consider the last partial: the input value is divided by 5 and multiplied 
   by 2\*pi (hence voltages from 0 to 5V represent the entire circle). 
   All the partials between the first and the last will have intermediate 
   phase values that are also proportional to the partial index. 
   This means that the new phase of the partial with index `p` is calculated 
   as `in4*(2*pi)*p/(5*maxp)` 
 * Capped maximum value of the partials to avoid glitches: maximum value is 
   now 40 for Sine and the Poly\* waveforms, 80 for all other waveforms
 * Renamed acronym for normal comb and different comb to CN and CD
 * The fundamental is transposed one octave lower
 * Changed the startup preset to something more interesting (30 partials, comb)
 * 1 decimal value floating point print of fundamental input voltage

 * Stretch parameter is now represented in 1V/Octave format, so C0 is a
   multiplier of 0, C1 => 1, C2=> 2, C3 => 3 etc. This results in more harmonic results
   in sending pitch information to this parameter.

 * Changed naming of some parameters and settings
 * Human-readable abbreviations of the wave shapes instead of numbers
 * New "normal" comb filter amplitude scheme C1: various notches that can be shifted with the knob and CV input
 * New "different" comb filter amplitude scheme C2: similar to C1 but the frequency of the notches gets increases as the partial index get higher
 * Added a graphical visualization of the amplitude of the first 30 partials by using ASCII tricks
